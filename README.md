# Biclustering

## Description
This work accomplishes a CC biclustering analysis with real expression data from differentially expressed genes using **biclust** 
R package.

## Motivation
Biclustering has been proved to be efficient discovering co-expressed and co-regulated genes, however, whether it is a good approach to obtain clusters of DE genes with 
samples where they show similar expression values with respect to the others, remains challenging.

## System requirements
No system requirements needed.

## Install
Install R 4.0.x and install *biclust* packages.
Install RStudio version 1.4 or newer.
