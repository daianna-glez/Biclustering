# Biclustering analysis

## Description
This work was done as part of an undergraduate project at LCG - UNAM. It performs CC biclustering on real expression data from differentially expressed genes using *biclust* R package.

## Motivation
Biclustering has been proved efficient at discovering sets of co-expressed and co-regulated genes, however, its performance on similarly expressed genes it's left to be tested.

## System requirements
No system requirements needed.

## Install
Install R 4.0.x and install *biclust* packages.
Install RStudio version 1.4 or newer.
